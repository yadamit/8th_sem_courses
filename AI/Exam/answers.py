answer1 = "I think AI has already changed a lot about how we live our everyday life. \
For example, google search, speech recognintion, movie/product recommendations etc. \
In the next decade, I think more advanced applications of AI will be available including autonomous driving even on complex roads,\
drone surveillance for accidents/crimes, intelligent interactive robots, voice assistants and so on. AI can greatly improve medicine by accurately identifying diseases\
giving customimzed treatment and finding cure for presently uncurable diseases. Autonomous driving seems like possible in next few years, considering the amount of research going on right now.\
It has capbility of redcing accidents to minimal level while increasing efficiency and saving time. AI would also be able to predict weather accurately over a longer time period.\
Intelligent AI game players will be developed as well, even for very complex games with very high number of states. This will completly change how we play computer games.\
I think computer vision, voice recognition, reinforcement learning will be very effective in bringing the above mentioned changes.\
AI that won't' be possbile: In my view, Artificial General Intelligence won't be possible even in future. It actually depends upon how we define AGI. \
Current AI is capable of learning particualr tasks, like face recognition, pose estimation etc. But a general AI which can do everything like humans won't be possbile.\
I am also not very hopeful if the current AI will be go way ahead. Because it requires a lot of computation and computation power may not increase as rapidly as the need of it (failing Moore's law).\
So at some point in future, we will need to change the very basics of our algorithms which are presently based mostly on neural networks."
