# Knights, Knaves, and Spies
#
# This exercise is about solving a spy about telling the truth
# and lying. There are lots of puzzles like this, most of
# them easily expressible in logic. Some of the most famous
# ones are the Knights and Knaves puzzles presented in some
# of the books by Raymond Smullyan.
#
# We consider a variant of the Knights and Knaves puzzles
# with also a third category of persons, Spies.
# The specific properties of these person categories are that
#   - Knights always tells the truth
#   - Knaves always lie
#   - Spies can either tell the truth or lie
#
# An instance of the puzzles consists of indicating what
# the given persons say, and then the task is to figure
# out who is telling the truth and who is lying:
#   You meet three persons. Call them A, B, C.
#   You know that one is a Knight, one is a Knave, and one is a Spy.
#   Each of them makes a statement. First A, then B, and last C.
#   Which one is which?

# Below we have given part of the code needed for formalizing
# these puzzles. Your task is to complete the code and see that
# the puzzles get solved correctly. The test instances have
# exactly one solution.
